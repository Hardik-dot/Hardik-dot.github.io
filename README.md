## Professional
<h3> Nomura </h3> New York NY
Technology Summer Analyst, Jun 2022 - Aug 2022
•	Migrated Nomura’s Trade Reporting Application hosted on a legacy windows server to a containerized docker application on Nomura’s Virtual Private Cloud.
•	Container architecture enabled executing multiple jobs simultaneously as separate container instances which led to a 40% reduction in time taken to execute all jobs.
•	Integrated Elastic stack to aggregate 700+ daily reports, process and index them thus creating a unified searchable catalog with visualization and metrics.

<h3> Samsung Research </h3> <p>Bangalore, India</p>
<p>Senior Software Engineer , Mar 2021 - Aug 2021</p>
•	Used Supervised learning models (kNN, Random Forest Classifier) to predict with 92% accuracy if device will successfully attach to a particular 5G cell
•	Implemented data extraction tool using Python to parse required data points from 1000s of GBs of device logs reducing roughly 800 hours of manual effort
•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand correlation between network parameters and discovered hidden trends in the dataset

<h3> Samsung Research </h3> <p>Bangalore, India</p>
<p> Software Engineer , Mar 2021 - Aug 2021</p>
•	Developed a log analyzer which led to faster defect analysis and reduced time taken to resolve an issue from 2 hours to 30 mins thus improving efficiency by 75%
•	Wrote python scripts which extracted important KPIS and information from logs providing analysis specific to each scenario as a dynamic HTML page, Text & Excel formats

<h3> Goldman Sachs </h3> <p>Bangalore, India</p>
Technology Summer Analyst, May 2018 - Jun 2018
•	Used Angular to develop a modern user interface which allowed employees to submit reimbursement requests and compliance officers to review these requests
